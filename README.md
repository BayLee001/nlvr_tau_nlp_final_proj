# nlvr_tau_nlp_final_proj

This directory contains the files and directories used for our final project, for NLP and advanced machine learning courses, in TAU, spring senester 2017.
as well as the needed data.


## Repository tructure:

* **data** :  contains most of the data needed for the project, including the original data set and other data used or generated by us.
* nlvr-data : the oroginal data set
* logical forms : data needed to use the
* parsed sentences : patterns aof sentences and their respective, manually prepared, annotations, and the data dets for supervised pre-train generated from them
* sentence processing : data needed for sentence processing


* **seq2seqModel** : contains all files and data with the impementation of the model
* data directories:
		learnedWeightsPreTrain : weights learned from running the pre-training using generated sentences and annotations in certain common patterns
		learnedWeightsWeaklySupervised : weights learned by the weakly supervised model (learning from denotations). The current weights in the dir are those achieving the beat results so far on the dev and test data sets.
		running_logs : for saving logs with results of running training or testing of the model.
		word2vec : word embeddings used by the model and the code used for creating them.
		

	* .py files:
			seq2seq.py : this is the only runnable file in the directory. It contains the tf model, and the functions for training and evaluating the model. : 
			beam_search.py : our implementation of epsilon greedy randomized beam search
			beam_boosting.py : functions used for boosting the baseline performance of the beam search
			utils.py: utility functions used by seq2seq.py
			partial_program.py : contains the class PartialProgram that is used to wrap the programs in the beam
			hyper_params : constants and boolean properties of the model. can be changed between runs. 
		
		
* .py files:
* **definitions** : relative paths to important directories and files.
	** data_manager** : loads the needed data, processes it and return as an object that is convenient to work with.
	** sentence processing** : used by the data manager to preprocess the sentences in the data, in order to reduce noise (e.g. generated by spelling errors) in the data.
	** logical forms **: the code for the functions that are run when executing a logical form on a structured rep of an image
	** structured_rep: classes representing the structured representation of an image in the data set.
